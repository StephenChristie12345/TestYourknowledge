Test Your Knowledge is a mobile quiz application developed for an assignment in the IMAD5111 subject. The app was built using Kotlin code in Android Studio. Its main goal is to present users with a 5 question quiz using True/False statements, track their answers, and display their final score. 

This app meets the assignment requirements by offering a fully functioning quiz experience, version controlled with GitHub, and integrated with GitHub Actions for automated testing.

Challenges and Learnings  

Challenge 1:  Gif 

My first challenge was adding a gif, I wanted to add an animation of a soldier saluting on the home page but was unsuccessful and kept it as a normal image  

 Challenge 2: Score 

My second challenge was transferring my score successfully rom page to page as on each try i was getting a wrong total score. To fix this I made sure you could only answer a question once but disabling the buttons upon selection  

 Challenge 3: Design  

I am disappointed in my design i think it lacks visual apeal. I tried to add background images to the score page and hoe page but i=I wasn't looking good and was hiding a lot od my elemts so i decided to keep it plain, one thing to work on for y next app is y design  

Future Enhancements  

Randomized Questions: Add a pool of questions and randomly select 5 each time  

High Score Tracking: Save and display top scores  

Timed Quiz Mode: Introduce a timer to add pressure and challenge  

Sound Effects: Provide audio feedback for correct and incorrect Answers. 

 

Disclosure of Ai Usage in y Assessment:  

In the development of this project, i have used generative AI tools to assist me. I thought it would be unique to use my own images through AI generation but unfortunately was only able to use it ro two images. You will find  a link to this chat below in my reference list
